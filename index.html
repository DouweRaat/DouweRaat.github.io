        <p>Hi, I'm Douwe Raat. I'm 17 years old and I'm a student at the Metis Montessori Lyceum in the Coderclass. Here I've learned to use Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, C++, C#, Unity, Blender and more. The last 3 years of the Coderclass I've been working on awesome projects which are listed below.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>I worked on this project in the first half of 2022. In this VR-game the player is able to create their own world by placing giant LEGO bricks. It was a challenge to find a good system for the placement, but I eventually settled on a laser pointing towards the desired spot, together with a preview of the brick. The player is also able to change the color and shape of the bricks with the controllers. The game was made with Unity and the SteamVR plugin.</p>

            <p>This is a project I made together with Lawrence Zhu for our high school thesis. We made 2 games to answer the question: "To what extend are holograms suitable for videogames?" The games we made are named Pong-3D and Tanks-3D. These are both 3D versions of previously existing games: Pong and a flash-game named Tanks. We made each game with 3 different display options: a regular laptop screen, projected in a plastic pyramid and projected in the HOLOFIL-cardboard.</p>

            <p>Quantum Quest is a web class for high school students, which I took part in in november/december 2020. The course is organized by the University of Amsterdam, QuSoft, Ruhr University Bochum and CASA and teaches the mathematics behind Quantum Computers. The group I worked with and I got some of the highest grades in the course, which we each recieved two books for.</p>

            <p>BOB ROB is a game I made with Unity in the 1st half of 2021. The player controls Bob Rob, a cowboy making his way through the desert. Bob Rob moves automatically, but the player decides when he jumps over obstacles and when he shoots enemies in his way. The goal of the game is to get as high of a score as possible while avoiding the increasingly difficult obstacles. BOB ROB is playable with the first link below.</p>

            <p>In the 2nd half of 2021 I took part in the course Programming with C++. The course was organized for the Coderclass by the Pre-University College team of the VU. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming. The emphasis was on how a computer executes programmes and how the concepts from C++ are translated into machine instructions. The course consisted of 14 interactive lectures of an hour and 86 hours of working on the programming assignments.</p>
